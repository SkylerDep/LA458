<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hello, <br> My name is <b>Skyler DePerry.</b> I am a senior in Community and Regional Planning. I live in an apartment off campus but fairly close to campus. I don't have any experience with HTML & JavaScript or coding in general but I have taken a few GIS courses and am trying to minor in GIS so i have some experience with that. I hope to gain some skill with coding and learn how to incorporate a knowledge of web mapping in my future career path.</p>
